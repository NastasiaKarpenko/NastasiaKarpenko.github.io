    <p>I am determined to pursue the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Web Development) at NCI to deepen my skills and knowledge in web development.</p> 
    <p>Having experienced the devastating impact of war in my motherland, I had to leave everything behind - my career, education, home and beloved people. Starting anew in a new country, I am eager to become independent, secure employment, and shape a better future for myself and my child.
</p>
<p>
I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can transform our lives. With a strong background in Human Resources, I seek to transition into a web development career. My experience in recruitment, employee relations, and team support within the software development sector has equipped me with valuable soft skills. As a Human Resources professional with experience in the IT sector, I have had the opportunity to work alongside developers and learn more about the field.
</p>
<p>
To take my first steps  in web development, I completed a coding course with SheCodes, where I gained knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, API, Bootstrap, and GitHub. Additionally, I completed an IT Development Process Course, focusing on general information about technical writing, CI, and project support. Iâ€™ve just enrolled in the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course, which has allowed me to delve deeper into computer science fundamentals. 
</p>
<p>
The Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Web Development) at NCI presents a remarkable opportunity for my professional growth, opening doors to new possibilities for me. I hope it will provide me with advanced technical knowledge and instil confidence in my ability to take care of myself and my child. I am highly motivated and committed to excelling in this program, utilizing my past experiences and acquired skills.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I am ready to embark on this transformative journey, embracing the challenges that lie ahead while remaining focused on building a prosperous future through web development.
